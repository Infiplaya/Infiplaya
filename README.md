### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m PaweÅ‚, a passionate amateur programmer who wants to learn as much as I can about web development and build cool apps! Iâ€™ve finished CS50 - Harvardâ€™s introductory course in computer science where I learned many interesting things about programming world, created game demo using LUA framework LÃ–VE, and did many hard but fun problems. I've also finished CS50 Python - Harvardâ€™s introductory course for Python. Iâ€™m deeply interested in web development technologies such as JavaScript, CSS, React, NextJS, and tailwind CSS, and using them to build fun websites and solve problems.

Besides programming, I enjoy reading books, listening to my favorite music and meeting with my friends.
